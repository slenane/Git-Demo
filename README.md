# Git-Demo

Test repository to better understand how to use Git and GitHub

## What I learned

- clone repository into code editor
- work on repository
- check status of changes (git status)
- add and commit changes to Git (git add / git commit -m "message")
- push to GitHub (git push)

- creating a new branch (git checkout -b branchName)
- switching between branches (git checkout branchName)
- push a branch to GitHub
